# Harvard Art Explorer
## Phase 2 Project
### About
This project was completed during the full-time Software Engineering program at the Flatiron School. Phase 2 was the introduction to Reactjs and I decided to create a project using the Harvard Museum of Art API which would allow a user to virtually explore objects in the museum's collection.

The Harvard Museum of art can be found here: https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections

### Technologies Used
This project was developed using JavaScript, ReactJS, and deployed with a backend hosted in Heroku.
